# Little Red Riding Hood: A Data Analysis

A humorous data science project investigating when Little Red Riding Hood was most likely eaten by analyzing historical wolf attack patterns.

## 🐺 Project Overview

Using a dataset of 462 wolf attacks worldwide (dating back to the 14th century), this project analyzes attack patterns by month and victim gender to determine the most likely time Little Red Riding Hood met her fate.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Advanced Data Wrangling**: Custom regex-based parsing to extract victim counts and gender from messy historical data
- **Multiple Visualizations**: Bar charts and line graphs showing attack patterns by month and gender
- **Interactive Plots**: Zoom-able incident breakdowns using Plotly

## 🔗 Links

- **Google Colab Notebook**: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JesP5G68ZXD_oTfH_2jJ6D5rVrnHM22F)
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Global Wolf Attacks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danela/global-wolf-attacks)

## 📈 Key Findings

- **If Little Red Riding Hood was female**: Most likely eaten in **June**
- **Gender unknown**: Still most likely **June**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Regex)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Kaggle API
