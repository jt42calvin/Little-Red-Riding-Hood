# Little-Red-Riding-Hood

We found an interesting graphic on Kaggle aiming to determine when Little Red Riding Hood (from the fairy tale) was most likely eaten. The author claims with the graphic that Little Red Riding Hood was probably eaten in June. The author used a Wikipedia dataset of 462 wolf attacks worldwide, the earliest in the 14th century, and totaled the attacks by month and by gender. The dataset includes the columns:

- Victims: the name, age, and gender of the victim(s) (not all present in every record)
- Date: date or year of the attack (variety of entry forms as well)
- Type of attack: whether the attack was predatory, unprovoked, rabid, etc.
- Location: place of attack
- Notes: description of the attack if any

The data can be found here:
